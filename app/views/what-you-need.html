    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How certification works on the IAX</h1>

     <p>Participants will need to prove they meet all the standards and rules of the Identity and Attributes Exchange (IAX).</p>

     <p>You’ll do this by answering questions about how your organisation works and providing evidence of any existing certificates you have.</p>

     <p>How many questions you’ll be asked depends on the:</p>

     <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
       <li>role you want to perform on the IAX</li>
       <li>level of certification you want to achieve</li>
       <li>level of risk associated with your service</li>
       <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">level of assurance</a> you want to provides</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Stages of certification</h3>

    <p>The certification process is in 2 stages.</p>

    <p>Firstly, you’ll need to complete an application form which covers:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>details about your organisation</li>
      <li>all the relevant standards you’ll need to meet</li>
      <li>information about your service</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once an auditor has assessed your application you can move on to the second stage.</p>

    <p>You’ll then need to provide more detailed technical information in:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the base criteria document</li>
      <li>any other relevant criteria document</li>
      <li>the service specification document</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You’ll also be asked to provide evidence that proves you meet all the relevant standards.</p>

    <p>You’ll need to choose an auditor to work with and they’ll help to guide you through the assessment process.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 1: check your eligibility</h3>

    <p>To be eligible to apply for certification, you’ll need to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>have built your service</li>
      <li>follow a quality management system, for example ISO 9001 or equivalent</li>
      <li>follow a recognised security standard, for example ISO 27001 or equivalent</li>
      <li>follow data protection rules and regulations, for example GDPR</li>
      <li>follow internationally recognised risk management standards, such as ISO/IEC 31000, ISO/IEC 27005</li>
      <li>carry out internal audits</li>
      <li>keep audit records and security logs - these should include dates and times of any system compromises and what you did to fix them</li>
      <li>have someone on your management team who's responsible for security policies and systems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you’re unsure if you meet any of these, contact the authoritative body [LINK] for more information.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 2: apply for certification</h3>

    <p>Complete the application form and return it to the authoritative body. The application form contains details about:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your organisation</li>
      <li>your service</li>
      <li>how you meet the IAX’s standards and rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your application form will be reviewed by the authoritative body to ensure you meet the IAX’s standards and rules. You can then move on to the assessment stage.</p>

    <p>Once you know you can continue, you should choose an auditor from the IAX’s approved list.</p>

    <p>Your auditor will:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>guide you through the assessment process</li>
      <li>confirm the level of assessment you need, this will be either approval or full certification</li>
      <li>decide if you pass or fail assessment your service</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 3: get assessed</h3>

  <p>Your auditor will ask you for any more evidence they need to see. It’s their job to make sure you meet all the relevant standards.</p>

  <p>You’ll need to involve different people in your organisation, for instance technical and compliance experts.</p>

  <p>You’ll be asked to provide more technical and detailed information about your service and organisation, including:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a detailed description of your service and how it meets relevant government standards, for example ‘How to prove and verify someone’s identity’</li>
      <li>how your organisation operates, for instance how you manage risk and data security</li>
      <li>technical diagrams outlining how your service works</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You’ll also need to gather and send the auditor any evidence they want to see. They’ll advise you where you need to provide more evidence or information.</p>

    <p>The assessment may involve an on-site audit. Your auditor will let you know if you need this. The assessment stage normally takes about 3 weeks.</p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 4: joing the IAX</h3>

    <p>When your auditor has made a decision they’ll let you know and also pass their pass or fail recommendation to the authoritative body.</p>

    <p>Before you can join the IAX you may be asked to adapt your service to meet the relevant standards.</p>

    <p>Once the authoritative body has confirmed the auditor’s positive assessment, you should:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>sign the contract</li>
      <li>agree to the IAX’s terms and conditions</li>
      <li>start using the IAX’s trust mark</li>
      <li>join the IAX</li>
    </ul>
