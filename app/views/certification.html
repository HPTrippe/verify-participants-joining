    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Get certified to be part of the IAX</h1>

      <p>You’re ready to be certified once you’ve:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>decided on the role you want to play in the IAX</li>
        <li>been given an auditor you want to work with</li>
        <li>built your service</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Before you start certification</h2>

      <p>Your auditor will need to check you meet some conditions before you can be certified. You’ll need to <a href="/public/pre-application-checklist.odt">complete the pre-assessment checklist</a> before they can do this.</p>

      <p>If your auditor confirms you meet all the required conditions, you must <a href="/apply">apply to join the IAX</a>. You're now ready to be certified.</p>

      <p>You can read more about the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bVE-KAWJoOdoeqkYy3ww-OhTly7l2ZYvcYryhz4ogFM">certification process (Google Docs)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Complete a statement of conformity</h2>

      <p>Your auditor will ask you to complete a statement of conformity. The statement of conformity includes:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a brief description of your service</li>
        <li><a href="/standards">evidence you meet the necessary criteria</a>, for example your company is registered with Companies House</li>
        <li>evidence that you follow a recognised risk management standard</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your auditor will use this information to tell you if you:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>need to provide more evidence before you can apply</li>
        <li>can make the certification process quicker using certificates you already have or regulations you already meet</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Complete your application</h2>

      <p>You’ll need to provide more information so your auditor can evaluate your application.</p>

      <p>You’ll need to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1LwU8TEGUyouQJd7Jw-mrPiAYW7jOyc8Bc0kirDxY8">write a full description of your service (Google Docs)</a> and send it to your auditor</li>
        <li>send your auditor any other evidence they ask to see</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The auditor will also assess your technical competence and the controls you have in place. They'll do this using profiles. You’ll be assessed against the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LGHPxGhDiOQWvqZ6arJ82J72Y0pk0uGK4wbplvgGrbU">identity provider profile (Google Docs)</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s9OAGg_nMd1Lp_ZNg2ZWu7yf7htSRijOdTcTsxe46BE">base profile (Google Docs)</a>.</p>

      <p>The profiles list the evidence you need to provide to pass certification.</p>

      <p>Your auditor will:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>advise on any areas in your application that you need to provide more detail about</li>
        <li>check you comply with the IAX's <a href="/standards">standards and rules</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Working with your auditor</h2>

      <p>The auditor may need to ask you some follow up questions about the evidence you’ve submitted. </p>
      <p>Your auditor will decide if they have enough information to make a decision or if an onsite audit is necessary.</p>
      <p>Onsite audits are needed because of the complexity of the role you’ll play on the IAX. Some roles will need 2 onsite audits.</p>
      <p>Given the current situation, wherever possible the auditor will do a remote audit and desk review of the evidence you supply and arrange a remote meeting as a follow up.</p>
      <p>Your auditor will tell you what you need to do and what happens next.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Getting certified</h2>

      <p>Once the audit process is complete, the auditor will let you know if they’ll be recommending a pass or fail.</p>
      <p>If they recommend a pass, they’ll submit the evidence and their decision to the authoritative body. The authoritative body will review the evidence and confirm if they agree with the decision. </p>
      <p>If you’ve failed, your auditor will suggest what you can do now. For instance, they may arrange another onsite audit or ask you to provide further evidence. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What's next</h2>
      <p>Once the authoritative body has confirmed you’ve passed, you’re ready to <a href="/sign-contract">sign the contract</a> with the IAX and start using the trustmark.</p>
