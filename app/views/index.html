      <p>The Identity and Attributes Exchange (IAX) is a way to reuse digital identities and attributes across the public and private sector. It helps people prove their identity in an easy, secure way.</p>
      <p>Members of the IAX scheme are certified against a set of government-approved standards. This means they can trust each other when they share information.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why digital identities and attributes are important</h2>

      <p>Digital identity is an important part of the UK's digital economy and society.</p>
      <p>Anyone should be able to create a digital identity which they can use to do things securely online. A digital identity might also help someone with interactions or transactions in the real world, for example proving how old they are when they buy age-restricted goods.</p>
      <p>Your organisation can use digital identities to help users do more things online and improve your existing services. Not using digital identities will mean people have to continue to interact and do things with your organisation through other channels, such as over the phone or by filling in paper forms. These can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>be expensive</li>
          <li>be inefficient</li>
          <li>put people off completing the transaction</li>
          <li>put people and your organisation at risk of fraud</li>
        </ul>

      <p>As well as being sure that someone is who they say they are, many organisations also need to know if someone is eligible to do certain things. They can do this by finding and checking additional information about someone (also known as 'attributes') along with, or separately from, their digital identity.</p>
